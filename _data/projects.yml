  description: We analyze the case of putting forth a interface for generating 3D scenes from input texts. The component of natural language understanding is framed as a problem of semantic parsing, in which a structured representation of input texts is created and then linking it together for a meaningful representation of scenes in space. We incorporate a dataset of 3D objects that are recorded with natural language texts and learn how to generate 3d scenes from descriptive texts. This system renders 3D scenes for a correct user input by analyzing text parameters and also allows user to interact with the generated scene.
